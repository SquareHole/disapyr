# Project Roadmap: Disapyr Improvement

## Project Overview
This roadmap outlines the plan for improving the Disapyr application based on a comprehensive code review. Disapyr is a web application that allows users to store a secret and generate a unique URL for retrieving that secret. The secret can be copied to the clipboard and reshared, generating a new unique URL.

## High-Level Goals

### 1. Enhance Security
- [x] Conduct comprehensive security review
- [x] Improve JWT token validation
- [x] Fix TLS verification bypass
- [x] Implement proper error handling to prevent information leakage
- [x] Add database connection pooling and timeouts

### 2. Improve Architecture
- [ ] Implement service layer to separate business logic from HTTP handlers
- [ ] Create repository layer to abstract database operations
- [ ] Implement robust configuration system
- [ ] Add request logging middleware

### 3. Enhance Code Quality
- [ ] Standardize error handling patterns
- [ ] Extract hardcoded values to configuration
- [ ] Improve test coverage
- [ ] Add comprehensive code documentation

### 4. Improve User Experience
- [ ] Enhance error handling in UI
- [ ] Implement progressive enhancement for JavaScript-disabled browsers
- [ ] Add secret expiration options
- [ ] Improve mobile responsiveness

## Completion Criteria
- All critical security issues are resolved
- Architecture follows clean separation of concerns
- Code quality meets industry standards
- User experience is improved with better error handling and accessibility
- Test coverage is increased to at least 80%

## Progress Tracking

### Completed Tasks
- [x] Conduct comprehensive code review
- [x] Create documentation structure
- [x] Develop prioritized implementation plan
- [x] Improve JWT token validation with audience and issuer verification
- [x] Fix TLS verification bypass with proper certificate handling
- [x] Add database connection pooling and timeouts

### In Progress
- [ ] Implementing service layer to separate business logic from HTTP handlers

### Upcoming
- [ ] Architectural improvements
- [ ] Code quality enhancements
- [ ] UI/UX improvements

## Future Scalability Considerations
- Potential migration to a more scalable database solution
- Implementation of a caching layer for improved performance
- Support for multiple secret types (text, files, etc.)
- Analytics and monitoring system for usage patterns
